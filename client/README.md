# GSCP Client
client side to GSCP API

## client version 0.14.1

## to do
- [x] improve application structure to something scalable and maintainable (redux) [8/28/2017]
  - [x] http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html [9/12/2017]
    - [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs
  - [ ] normalize data
  - [ ] normalize es6/7 api with a polyfills
- [x] implement react router https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/auth-workflow
    - [x] learn how to unit test router with redux [9/7/2017]
    - [ ] e2e/integration test router & redux
- [ ] need a proper release cycle from dev to stage and prod
- [ ] now might be a good time for sass?
- [x] add a task runner for version bumping [8/27/2017]
- [ ] rewrite client utility as a proper es6/7 class
    - [ ] comment/document
- [x] add a working linter & rules to ST3 on mac [9/12/2017]
- [ ] add auto-formatting for jsx to st3 on mac
- [ ] update lint rules to match mac on pc
- [ ] update formatting rules to match mac on pc
- [ ] context whitelisting?
- [x] new Wrapper container to handle all auth and redirect logic [9/11/2017]
    - [ ] this doesn't really seem like such a good pattern yet...
- [x] add a catch-all that redirects to dashboard [9/9/2017]
- [ ] logout component
- [ ] invest a day into cleaning up the entire client application
    - [ ] performance
    - [ ] comments/documenting
    - [ ] refactoring
        - [ ] refactor naming convention to remove *Container from container names and add *View to components instead of *Component? --this could make the app more difficult to reason about
        - [ ] find a better solution to redirecting to /login and perhaps just hide header/siderbar/ and all other applicable components and just display the login component?
- [ ] refactor actions to something more maintainable, possibly move them into the reducer folder and have a folder for each reducer, actions and action creators
- [ ] determine if the wrapper needs to be a container or component?
- [ ] revalidate proptypes for token and isloggedout considering token is both boolean and string
- [x] migrate to latest version of create-react-app [3/3/2018]
    - [x] client-side tests passing [3/4/2018]
    - [ ] deprecate client-old
